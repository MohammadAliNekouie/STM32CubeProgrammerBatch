# STM32CubeProgrammer Batch Script
Automated STM32CubeProgrammer Batch script for programming FUS + Wireless Stack + Firmware

This is a shell script as a BAT file for Windows that makes you do FUS + Wireless Stack and firmware programming in one stage for production.
Note that for using this script, you have to install the  STM32CubeProgrammer software and then run it.

This exmaple works on STM32WB55CG, but you can run it on any STM32 MCUs with FUS inside.
